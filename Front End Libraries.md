```
Update. Just made login working.

    run Git Bash or any Linux-like command line tool
    execute these commands, substitute your proxy instead

export HTTP_PROXY="http://proxy.XXXXXXXX.com:80/"
export HTTPS_PROXY="http://proxy.XXXXXXXX.com:80/"

    after this I was able to login using

firebase login --interactive
