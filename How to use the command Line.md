Here's how you memorize things:

Tell yourself you will do it. Don't try to find tricks or easy ways out of it, just sit down and do it.
Write what you want to memorize on some index cards. Put one half of what you need to learn on one side, then another half on the other side.
Every day for about 15-30 minutes, drill yourself on the index cards, trying to recall each one. Put any cards you don't get right into a different pile, just drill those cards until you get bored, then try the whole deck and see if you improve.
Before you go to bed, drill just the cards you got wrong for about 5 minutes, then go to sleep.
